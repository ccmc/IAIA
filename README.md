# Purpose

This repository supports the Information Architecture for Interactive Archives (IAIA) working group of the International Forum for Space Weather Capabilities Assessment. You may use it to share code and tools for describing metadata supporting space weather related projects. Make liberal use of the [Wiki](https://github.com/ccmc/IAIA/wiki), and feel free to include links to your own projects. The material presented here will help the CCMC staff keep the [IAIA website](https://ccmc.gsfc.nasa.gov/assessment/topics/data.php) synchronized with the working group's activities.
